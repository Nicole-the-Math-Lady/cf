# cloudflare-error-pages
Custom Artsy error pages for Cloudflare 500 and 1000 class errors.

The Cloudflare UI accepts an address for a static html page with maximum size of 1.5 MB. To change this page, the HTML must be uploaded to s3 and a that link will need to be republished via that Cloudflare UI.
